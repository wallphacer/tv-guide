# Tv-Guide

## Purpose
This is a project is designed to remove the complexity of choosing what to watch.
Say what you want about Channel surfing, the fact you could just see what's on right now, click and go was really helpful.

Having multiple streaming services, all with multiple streams of content is really difficult to track.
I wanted something I could just use to control what I wanted to watch, and it would just show it like a TV Guide.
